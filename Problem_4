//Problem 4: Mendel's First Law.
//
//Given: Three positive integers k, m, and n, representing a population containing organisms: individuals are homozygous dominant for a factor, are heterozygous, and
//are homozygous recessive.
//Return: The probability that two randomly selected mating organisms will produce an individual possessing a dominant allele (and thus displaying the dominant phenotype). Assume that any two organisms can mate.
